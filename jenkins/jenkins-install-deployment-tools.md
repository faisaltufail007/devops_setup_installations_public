# Setup and Install Deployment Tools on Jenkins

Certainly! Below are the detailed steps for installing Ansible and Capistrano on a Jenkins server:

1. **Installing Ansible**:

   Ansible can be installed on the Jenkins server using the package manager of your operating system. Here's how to install it on Ubuntu:

   - Update the package index:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```

   - Install Ansible:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install ansible
     ```

   - Verify the installation by checking the Ansible version:
     ```bash
     ansible --version
     ```

   Ansible should now be installed and available on your Jenkins server.

2. **Installing Capistrano**:

   Capistrano is a Ruby gem, so you'll need to install Ruby and then install Capistrano as a gem. Here's how to do it:

   - Install Ruby using a version manager like RVM (Ruby Version Manager) or rbenv. Here's an example using RVM:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install curl gnupg2 ca-certificates lsb-release
     \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
     source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
     rvm install ruby
     ```

   - Install Capistrano as a gem:
     ```bash
     gem install capistrano
     ```

   - Verify the installation by checking the Capistrano version:
     ```bash
     cap --version
     ```

   Capistrano should now be installed and available on your Jenkins server.

Once Ansible and Capistrano are installed on your Jenkins server, you can use them in your Jenkins jobs or pipelines to automate deployment tasks. You can invoke Ansible playbooks or Capistrano tasks directly from your Jenkinsfile or from shell commands within your Jenkins jobs. Make sure to configure any necessary credentials or configuration files required by Ansible or Capistrano to interact with your deployment targets.
