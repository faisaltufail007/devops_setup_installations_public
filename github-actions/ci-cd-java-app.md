# Automating the build, test, and deployment process for a sample Java application

Here's a basic example of a GitHub Actions workflow for automating the build, test, and deployment process for a sample Java application:

```yaml
name: Java CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          java-version: '11'

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn -B clean package

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
        with:
          java-version: '11'

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn -B test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build, test]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up SSH
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.3
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

      - name: Deploy to server
        run: |
          ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@example.com 'cd /path/to/application && git pull'
```

This workflow consists of three jobs:

1. **Build**: This job checks out the code, sets up the Java Development Kit (JDK), and builds the Java application using Maven.
2. **Test**: This job checks out the code, sets up the JDK, and runs the tests for the Java application using Maven.
3. **Deploy**: This job, which depends on the completion of the build and test jobs, checks out the code, sets up SSH for deployment, and then deploys the application to a server. Replace `user@example.com`, `/path/to/application`, and `${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}` with appropriate values for your deployment setup. Ensure that you have set up SSH keys and added the public key to the authorized keys on your deployment server.

You can adjust this workflow to fit your specific project requirements and deployment environment. For example, you may need to modify the build and test steps if you're using a different build tool or testing framework. Additionally, you might want to include additional steps for tasks like code quality checks, containerization, or publishing artifacts.
